Project about the Programing for IoT course.

NODE-Red

Node-RED is a dashboard that retrieves data from IoT devices, from the Thingspeak Adaptor, and
shows them graphically.It works with REST Web Services to get historical data from the
Thingspeak Adaptor to show them graphically.

So we get data from the Thingspeak and we show them.
